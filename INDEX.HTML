1.Object amd its internal representation in javascript :

Object , in javascript , is its most important data-typr 
(Number , String , Boolean , Null , Undefined and Symbol)
in the sence the while these primitive data-type all 
store a single value each (depending on their typr).
  
Loosely speaking , opject in javascript may be difined as andunorderd collection 
defind as an unorded collection of related data , of primitive or reference type , 
in the form of "Key:value" pairs. these keys can be variables or fuctions and are 
called properties and methods , respectively , in the context of object . 
 For Eg. if your object is a student , it will have  properties like name , age, 
adress , id ,etc and methods like update adress, updatenam , etc.


Object and properties
 A javascript object has properties associated With it. A property of object can be explained as a variables,
that is attached to the object .object properties are basically the same as ordinary 
javascript variables of an object defind the characteristics  of the object.
you access the properties of an object with a simple doy-notation : objectname :propertyname .


like all javascript variables, both the object name 
( Which could be normal variables) and propertyname 
name are case sensitive . for example , lets create an object .
named my car and give it properties names make model, and year as follows:


var mycar = new object();
mycar.make ="bucati";
mycar.model="chiron";
mycar.model=2022;
 

Creating object in javascript:
create javascript object with object literal:
one of easiest wat to create a javascript object is 
object literal, simply defind the propertyand value
inside curly braces as shown below 

let bike = {name:'supersport',maker:"ducati engine:1200cc'};
